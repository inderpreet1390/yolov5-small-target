<h1>Repository for improved yolov5 for small target detection</h1>


DotaToYolo converts DOTA annotation format to YOLO annotation format in txt

VisDronetoYOLO converts VisDrone annotation format to YOLO annotation format in txt

pngtojpg converts png files to jpg in a folder

Repository also contains two jupyter notebooks:
  DataExplorationClasswise: This notebook contains all classwise pixel area size analysis of objects in both DOTA and VisDrone dataset
  DataExploration: this notebook calculates average pixel area of all the objects of all classes in both DOTA and VisDrone dataset


The trained weights can be downloaded from gdrive below:




These trained weights can be used with Yolov5 official github repository [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to reproduce the results, the custom model file is also provided as yolov5-small-target.yaml that can be used in the official yolov5 models folder
